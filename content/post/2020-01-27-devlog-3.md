Today we visited the Museum of Nature's Natural Heritage Campus all the way in the depths of Aylmer. It was quite far but surprisingly accessible by bus, though I am fortunate to have gotten a ride back to campus with some of my other team members. 

This sessions felt less in depth than our visit to this History Museum last week, likely because of the amount of work that needs to be covered. We were able to take a look at various documents including logs, and cards that need to be digitized. The most interesting thing about working with these museums in Ottawa is the huge amount of documents that need to be digitized to spare them from being lost. I’m sure as we begin to work closer with our teams that we will be able to have a better understanding of the work that we will be doing. With the Nature Museum it seems like a lot to tackle, but that is exciting.

After we took a look at the documents that need to be digitized, we got to take a peek at some of the archaeofauna collections. It was so interesting seeing taxidermied mammals, and whales bones in the room for oversized objects. We also looked at different bone collections that were in their own specific cabinets, such as a dog, and a walrus. One of the people that worked at the Nature Museum pointed out that even the labelling on these cabinets are out of date. I’m really looking forward to diving in.
