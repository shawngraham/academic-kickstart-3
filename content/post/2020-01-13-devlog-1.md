I would like to work with the Nature Museum, looking at animal bones / archaeofaunal records seems fascinating. I've always loved animals. 

Discussion:
behind the scenes of museums; things in archives that are not on display
how to make museums more accessible?
decolonization of museums 

Hobby Lobby
found thousands of papyri fragments written in Coptic, Greek
contracts, diaries, bible, books of sale, etc.
buys 70,000 objects relating to early Christianity 

Collecting + Collectors; Informatics and Organizing Data 
metadata is more than just record keeping. Without good and accurate metadata, the objects themselves lose meaning
accurate and truthful metadata helps guard against unethical collecting
the bonetrade shows people trying to make their own museums, their own cabinets of curiosities; metadata not a concern for them except where it allows them to tell a story of their own heroic collecting; it is a popculture vision of archaeological knowledge acquisition

Bone Trade
museums have collected a ton of human remains 
made their way into private collections 
human zoos - live humans being put on display in living dioramas 
digital archaeology meets digital humanities 
people making their own museums with their bone collections

1.3 Collectors and Collecting 
Why do we Collect? 
preservation from inevitable historical decay / loss
argues that this reason is to legitimize theft of cultural heritage - First Nations
First Nations people do not need help preserving culture 
“preserve forever” mentality - Western idea of time being linear/irreversible
also leads to a question of ownership; can future indigenous people rescind ownership?
much First Nations cultural heritage in museums is displayed in the wrong context 
denies First Nations peoples’ autonomy regarding their own cultural heritage
museums say they preserve for everyone but often conflicts w/ FN interests 
“Colonisation is what is killing our cultures.  If our culture is dying, I’d rather it dies with us, than behind glass at a museum”   – Courtney Marsh

Collections: How We Hold the Stuff We Hold in Trust
transforming the way museums think about collections as most started in colonial period
paradigm that once the Museum possesses something they alone own it, holding on tightly 
reframe institution’s authority from ownership to collaboration + transparency 

1.4 Informatics and Organizational Cultural Heritage
Museum Informatics - Paul Marty
museum informatics - study of sociotechnical interactions that take place at the intersection of people, information, and technology in museums 
museums are not just repositories of objects they are also repositories of knowledge
museums pros have worked on better managing information resources in museums 
more sophisticated application of info tech for use in museums 
digitization, info storage + retrieval, collections management

Calm Technology in Museums - Cathy Sigmond
calm technology - design philosophy that aims to respect our “humanness” by reducing complexity to promote focus and calm
